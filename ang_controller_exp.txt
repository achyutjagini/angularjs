
The line of code "var app = angular.module('myApp', []);" creates a new AngularJS

module with the name "myApp." The empty array passed as the second argument is used to define 
the module's dependencies. In this case, since the array is empty, the module has no dependencies
on any other modules.
The "app" variable is assigned to the new module, which can be used to
configure and run the module in the rest of the code.


The code "app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {" creates a new controller called "myCtrl" 
and attaches it to the "myApp" module created previously. The function passed as the 
second argument
is a constructor function for the controller, and it is executed whenever AngularJS creates an 
instance of the controller.

Inside the function, the $scope variable is defined and assigned values to properties firstName 
and lastName as Jack and Doe respectively.
So now when the page loads, the default value of firstName is Jack and lastName is Doe, which 
will be displayed in the input field and also when we change the value of input field it will 
update the name.
