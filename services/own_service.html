<!--
This script defines an AngularJS application called 'myApp', and creates a service called 'hexafy' that
has a function 'myFunc'
which takes a number as input and converts it to a hexadecimal string.

The controller 'myCtrl' is then
defined and it has a dependency on the 'hexafy' service. In the controller, a scope variable 'hex' 
is set to the result of calling 'hexafy.myFunc(255)' which is the hexadecimal representation of the
decimal number 255 (which is FF).
This service can be used to convert any number to hexadecimal, it can be reused in other parts of
the application by injecting the service into the controllers that need it.
