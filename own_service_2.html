<!--This script defines an AngularJS filter called 'myFormat' that is dependent on the service 'hexafy' 
which has a function 'myFunc' which converts a given number into a hexadecimal number. The filter 
takes a number as input and returns the hexadecimal representation of that number by calling the 
'hexafy.myFunc(x)' . The filter can be used in the HTML template with the "pipe" character, for 
example: {{255| myFormat}} will output 'FF'
This way, the filter can be used to format any number as hexadecimal throughout the application,
by injecting the filter into the templates that need it, making it more reusable and maintainable.
It's important to notice that the filter is defined within the myApp module, but it's not being 
used by any controller or directive.

The square brackets [] are used to define the dependencies for the filter. In this case, the filter 'myFormat'
 has a dependency on the service 'hexafy'. The square brackets are used to define the dependencies that need to
  be injected into the filter, and the list of dependencies are passed as strings, so that AngularJS can identify
   and resolve them. The function that is passed as the second argument to the filter, takes the resolved 
   dependencies as its arguments. In this case, the filter is dependent on the service 'hexafy', and it's 
   passed as an argument to the function. So, the filter can use the 'hexafy' service to convert the 
   given number into a hexadecimal string.
