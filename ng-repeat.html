<!--This is an example of an AngularJS application that uses the "ng-repeat" 
directive to loop through an array of data.

The "ng-app" attribute is set to an empty string, indicating that this element 
is the root element of the AngularJS application.

The "ng-init" directive is used to initialize a variable "names" with an array 
of values ['Jani','Hege','Kai'].

The "ng-repeat" directive is used to loop through the elements of the "names" array 
and create a new <li> element for each one. The "ng-repeat" directive takes an expression 
that defines the loop, in this case "x in names". The "x" variable is a placeholder for 
the current element of the array, and "names" is the array that is being looped through.

The double curly brace notation {{}} is used to bind expressions to the view, in this
case the expression {{ x }} will be evaluated and the result will be displayed in the view.

The result of this code will be an unordered list with three list items, one for each
element in the names array, containing the value of each element.
