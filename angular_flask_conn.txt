Yes, AngularJS application can connect to a Flask server and retrieve JSON data. In order to do this,
 you will need to make an HTTP GET request to the endpoint of your Flask server that is responsible for
  providing the JSON data.

For example, you can use AngularJS's $http service in your controller to make an HTTP GET request to the
 endpoint, like this:

Copy code
$http.get("http://your-flask-server-url/api/data").then(function (response) {
    $scope.myData = response.data;
});

You need to make sure that the Flask server is running and providing the JSON data at the specified endpoint,
 and that the AngularJS application has the correct URL to reach the Flask server.
Also, you may need to configure the server to allow cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) if your AngularJS 
application and Flask server are running on different domains.

It's important to note that this is just a basic example, in a real-world scenario, you may need to handle
 errors, add security measures, and handle different types of data and formats.



how to make the flask server to provide the json data
In order to make a Flask server provide JSON data, you will need to create an endpoint in your Flask application that returns the JSON data.

Here is an example of a Flask endpoint that returns JSON data:

Copy code
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/api/data", methods=["GET"])
def get_data():
    data = {
        "name": "John Smith",
        "age": 35,
        "address": "123 Main St, Anytown USA"
    }
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
In this example, the endpoint is created using the @app.route decorator, which maps a URL 
path to a function. The /api/data path is mapped to the get_data function, which is responsible 
for returning the JSON data. The jsonify function is used to convert the dictionary to a JSON object,
 and it's returned as the response.

You can also use flask-restful library to provide json data and it's also more powerful and flexible.

Once the endpoint is created and the server is running, you can make an HTTP GET request to the
 endpoint from your AngularJS application, and it will receive the JSON data in response.

You can also use a database to store data and fetch it from there, you can use a ORM library 
like SQLAlchemy to connect to your database and fetch data.
