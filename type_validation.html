<!--This is an example of an AngularJS application that uses the "ng-model" and "ng-show"
directive to create a simple email validation form.
The "ng-app" attribute is set to an empty string, indicating that this element is the root element 
of the AngularJS application.

The "form" element has a "name" attribute set to "myForm" which will be used to reference the form
in AngularJS.

The "input" element has a "type" attribute set to "email" which will be used to check if the input
value is a valid email address. It also has a "name" attribute set to "myAddress" and an "ng-model" 
directive set to "text". The "ng-model" directive binds the input value to a variable "text"
in the scope.
The "span" element has an "ng-show" directive set to "myForm.myAddress.$error.email". This directive
is used to show or hide the element based on the expression. In this case, it will show the 
element if the value of "myForm.myAddress.$error.email" is true.

The "$error" object is provided by AngularJS and it contains information about validation errors
' for the input element. The "email" property is true if the input value is not a valid
email address.

The result of this code will be an input field where the user can enter an email address and if 
the input value is not valid an error message will appear.-->
