<!--
This code creates an AngularJS application with a directive called "w3TestDirective."

The directive is attached to the "myApp" module which is created using the "angular.module" function.

The directive is used to attach a template to the DOM element that has the directive's name
as an attribute. In this case, the directive is attached to the <div> element using the 
attribute "w3-test-directive".

The directive is defined using the "app.directive" method, which takes two arguments: the name 
of the directive (w3TestDirective), and a factory function that returns an object.

In the factory function we have template property with a string value "I was made in a directive
constructor!" which will be added to the DOM where the directive is used.

So when the page is loaded, the string "I was made in a directive constructor!" will be 
displayed on the page, as it was added to the DOM via the directive.
