
This is an HTML file that uses AngularJS, a JavaScript framework for
 building web applications. 
The script tag at the top of the file imports the AngularJS library from the Google Hosted
 Libraries.

The "ng-app" attribute on the div element indicates that this is the root element of 
the AngularJS application.

The "ng-model" directive on the input element creates a two-way data binding between the input 
field and the "name" property of the scope object. The h1 element uses double curly braces to 
display the value of the "name" property. When the user types into the input field, the text
they enter will be displayed in the h1 element in real time.

The ng-model directive in AngularJS is used to create a two-way data binding between an HTML element
and a property on the scope object.
 When the value of the HTML element changes, the corresponding property on the scope object is 
 updated, and vice versa. This allows the data in the scope to be updated automatically as the
user interacts with the HTML element.

For example, the following code creates a simple text input field and binds it to the "name" 
property of the scope object using the ng-model directive:

<input type="text" ng-model="name">
When the user types into the input field, the value of the "name" property on the scope object
 will be updated with the text they entered. You can also use the value of the "name" property\
 in your HTML to display it, like:

Copy code
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
The ng-model directive can also be used with other HTML elements, such as textarea, select,
 and checkbox. It can also be used with custom form controls, such as custom input fields, by
  creating a custom directive that implements the ngModelController.

In summary, the ng-model directive is a powerful feature of AngularJS that allows you to 
easily create dynamic and interactive forms by linking HTML elements to properties on the
 scope object.
