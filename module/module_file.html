<!--
myApp.js contains application module definition
myCtrl.js contains controller

This is an example of an AngularJS application. AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that allows 
developers to create dynamic web applications. The code includes a reference to the AngularJS 
library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and two JavaScript files, "myApp.js" and "myCtrl.js".

The "myApp" and "myCtrl" in the "ng-app" and "ng-controller" attributes respectively, are the names
of the AngularJS app and controller defined in the JavaScript files. The double curly brace notation

{{}} is used to bind expressions to the view, in this case the expressions firstName + " " + lastName
will be evaluated and the result will be displayed in the view.\

This code snippet is a part of an AngularJS application. It defines an HTML element with the "ng-app"
attribute set to "myApp". The "ng-app" attribute is used to define an AngularJS application. It tells
AngularJS that the element and its children are part of an AngularJS application and should be treated
as such. In this case, "myApp" is the name of the AngularJS application that is defined in a separate 
JavaScript file. The application will then use this element as the root element 
and will initialize the application and start the compilation process.
