<!--
If you use the ng-value directive instead of value in the option element, it will bind the expression
inside it to the value of the option, instead of the string value of the attribute. In this case,
the expression is "{{x.model}}", which means that the value of the option will be the value of the
"model" property of the car object.

Since the "selectedCar" variable in the scope is also bound to the value of the "model" property of
the selected car, there will be no change in the value of the "selectedCar" variable when the 
user selects a car from the dropdown list. This means that the text "You selected: {{selectedCar}}"
will not update, as the "selectedCar" variable has not been updated.
