<!--
This is an AngularJS code snippet which uses AngularJS library (v1.6.9) and it creates an HTML 
form with a single input field that is bound to the "myText" variable using the ng-model directive.
The input field is marked as "required" using the "required" attribute.

It also includes a stylesheet that applies a background color of "lightblue" to the input field when 
it is in an "invalid" state. The "ng-invalid" class is a built-in AngularJS class that is applied to
form fields that are not valid.

In this case, when the input field is empty, it is considered "invalid" because it is required, and the
"ng-invalid" class will be applied to the field, causing its background color to change to light blue.
Also, it includes a <p> tag which is providing information that when the text field is edited it will 
get or lose classes according to the status.
