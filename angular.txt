
As you have already seen, AngularJS directives are
HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.

The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an 
AngularJS application.


The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

The ng-bind directive binds the content of the <p> element to the application variable name.
The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.
