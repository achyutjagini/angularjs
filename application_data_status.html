<!--This is an example of an AngularJS application that uses the "ng-model", "ng-init" and "required" 
attribute to create a simple email validation form and also 
display the status of the input field.

The "ng-app" attribute is set to an empty string, indicating that this element is the root element 
of the AngularJS application.

The "form" element has a "name" attribute set to "myForm" and also an "ng-init" directive which 
is used to initialize the variable "myText" with a default email address 'post@myweb.com'.

The "input" element has a "type" attribute set to "email" which will be used to check if the input'
value is a valid email address. It also has a "name" attribute set to "myAddress" and an "ng-model"
directive set to "myText". The "ng-model" directive binds the input value to a variable "myText" in
the scope. It also has a "required" attribute which makes the input field mandatory and forces the
validation to check if the input field is empty or not.

The "p" elements inside the form has expressions which are {{myForm.myAddress.$valid}}, 
{{myForm.myAddress.$dirty}} and {{myForm.myAddress.$touched}}. These expressions are used to display 
the status of the input field whether it is valid, dirty or touched.

The "$valid" property is provided by AngularJS and it returns true if the input value is valid 
according to the validation rules such as required and email validation.
The "$dirty" property is provided by AngularJS and it returns true if the
input value has been changed.
The "$touched" property is provided by AngularJS and it returns true if the input
field has been in focus.

The result of this code will be an input field with a default email address where the user
can edit the address, and try to change the status. And below the input field, it will show 
whether the input field is valid, dirty, or touched.

This is an AngularJS code snippet that initializes an AngularJS application, creates a form named "myForm",
sets a default value for the "myText" variable to "post@myweb.com", and creates an email input field within 
the form that is bound to the "myText" variable and is marked as required.
The ng-app directive is used to define an AngularJS application, the ng-init directive is used to initialize
the application's data, and the ng-model directive is used to bind the input field's
value to the "myText" variable.

ng-init used to initialize variables

When a field is said to be "in focus," it means that the field is currently selected and ready for input.
This generally occurs when a user clicks on the field with a mouse or uses the tab key to navigate to the field.
The field will typically have a highlighted border or background to indicate that it is active and ready for input.
 In AngularJS, the "$touched" property of a form field is used to track whether the field has been in focus or not.
